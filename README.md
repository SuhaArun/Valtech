# Valtech
I have used JAVA- CUCUCMBER-SELENEIUM and followed PAGE OBJET MODEL as best practice. Each question has three files - Feature file, Step file and Page object file.

The second question has 3 scenarios - to assert titles of About, Work, Services pages. 

The third question has getofficesCount to get the count of total Valtech offices using FIND ELEMENTS. I have also used locators like classname and linkText to find the elements in PAge object file.
